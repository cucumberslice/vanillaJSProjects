    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    let team = players.slice();
    console.log(team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'lux'

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
let team2 = [].concat(players)
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
let team3 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
// const captain = person;
// captain.number = 99;
    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age:12})

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person}

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
const wes = {
  name: 'wes',
  age:100,
  social: {
    twitter: '@wesbos',
    facebook:'wesbos.develoepr'
  }
}
console.log(wes);

// with spread operator, we can only go one level deep
// so a better alternative is to use deep cloning or poor men's deep clone

const dev  = Object.assign({}, wes); // only goes one level deep
// alternative
const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes))
